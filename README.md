This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Introduction

Path finding algorithms plays a vital role in our daily life such as packets in computer networks , google maps uses a path finding algorithm to find the shortest path. So this project main idea is to visualize this path finding algorithms using react with the help of some css animations.

## Algorithm used for shortest path

### Dijkstra

- Dijkstra's Algorithm lets us prioritize which paths to explore. Instead of exploring all possible paths equally, it favors lower cost paths.
- It is the algorithm of choice for finding the shortest path paths with multiple destinations.
